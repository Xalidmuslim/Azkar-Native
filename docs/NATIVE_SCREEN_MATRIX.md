# Native Screen Matrix — Azkar

Source: current `azkar-web` golden master. This matrix enumerates structural screens/states represented by the source and data; it does not add new native flows.\n\n**Phase-0.5 runtime note:** current `azkar-web/app-core.js` has a confirmed syntax error at lines 383–386, so none of its runtime screen/navigation behavior currently executes. Structural screen inventory remains useful, but interaction rows must be read together with `docs/NATIVE_BEHAVIOR_CONTRACT.md`. The broken/non-rendering state is `WEB_BUG` and is not a native requirement.

## 1. Primary surfaces

| ID | Surface/state | Entry | Required content | Main actions | Exit/back behavior to preserve |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S01 | Main — Morning — Cards | Source intends local hour 04:00–15:59, or tap “Утро” | Topbar, source note, period tabs, progress card, sticky reading toolbar, one dhikr card, pager, footer | Settings, contents, reset, count, insight, prev/next, horizontal swipe | **No active runtime currently (WEB_BUG).** History-aware behavior is not canonical. |
| S02 | Main — Evening — Cards | Source intends local hour 16:00–03:59, or tap “Вечер” | Same structure as S01 with evening-filtered data and evening text variants where present | Same as S01 | **No active runtime currently (WEB_BUG).** |
| S03 | Main — Morning — List | Choose “Список” from Contents while morning active | All 14 morning-visible dhikrs, no pager | Settings, contents, reset, count, insight, vertical scroll | View mode is persisted |
| S04 | Main — Evening — List | Choose “Список” from Contents while evening active | All 13 evening-visible dhikrs, no pager | Same as S03 | View mode is persisted |
| S05 | Contents bottom sheet — Cards mode | Reading toolbar → “Содержание” | Header, mode switch, one row per visible item, active item highlighting, completion checkmarks | Switch cards/list, jump to item, close | **No active runtime currently.** The earlier pushState/Back path is overridden in a minimally repaired file and is not canonical. |
| S06 | Contents bottom sheet — List mode | Same, while list mode active | Same list; no “active current card” state unless cards mode is selected | Switch mode, jump, close | Jump in list mode renders then smooth-scrolls target into view |
| S07 | Settings bottom sheet | Topbar or reading toolbar settings button | Live preview, Russian fonts, Arabic fonts, three sliders, reader style, 3 visibility toggles, theme selector | Change font/size/line-height/style/toggles/theme, close | Changes save immediately |
| S08 | Insight bottom sheet | “Разъяснение · история · слова учёных” | Sheet header + meaning + optional context + scholar notes + references | Close | **No active runtime currently.** `selectedId` is represented in source state, but history-aware modal behavior is not canonical. |

## 2. Card-state matrix

Every main surface must support these existing card states.

| ID | Card state | Trigger/data condition | Visual contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| C01 | Unread, count=1 | progress < 1 and item.count=1 | Counter `0 / 1`; action label “Прочитано” |
| C02 | Unread, count>1 | progress < target | Numeric current count + target; action “+1 · осталось N” |
| C03 | Completed | progress >= item.count | Done border, 3px left success strip, circular ✓, “Выполнено”, disabled “✓ Готово” |
| C04 | Disputed | item.disputed=true and notes visible | Warning badge “есть разногласие” |
| C05 | Disputed hidden | item.disputed=true and notes disabled | Warning badge absent because badge is gated by `showNotes` |
| C06 | With note | item.note exists and notes visible | Warning-tinted note box |
| C07 | Note hidden | notes disabled | Note box absent |
| C08 | With insight | item.insight exists | Full-width explanation action present |
| C09 | Translation visible | showTranslation=true | Translation block with solid top border |
| C10 | Translation hidden | showTranslation=false | Translation block absent |
| C11 | Source visible | showSources=true | Dashed source row |
| C12 | Source hidden | showSources=false | Source row absent |
| C13 | Morning/evening variant | item has eveningArabic/eveningTranslation and evening period active | Use evening-specific Arabic + translation |
| C14 | Default text variant | morning period or no evening override | Use `arabic` + `translation` |

## 4. Settings-state matrix

| ID | Setting | Default | Existing options/range | Immediate effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ST01 | Arabic font | Noto Naskh Arabic | Noto Naskh, Noto Sans Arabic, Amiri, Scheherazade New | Arabic body + preview |
| ST02 | Russian font | Literata | Literata, PT Serif, Inter, Manrope, Android Sans, Android Serif | Reader/translation typography + preview |
| ST03 | Arabic size | 32px | 22–44, step 1 | CSS variable; preview capped at 24px |
| ST04 | Russian size | 17px | 13–25, step 1 | CSS variable; preview capped at 15px |
| ST05 | Line height | 1.65 | 1.25–2.00, step .05 | Arabic + Russian reader line-height and preview |
| ST06 | Reader style | book | book / compact | Compact card padding becomes 12px |

| ST10 | Theme | auto | auto / light / dark | Root dark class and theme-color |
| ST11 | View mode | cards | cards / list | Persisted separately as `azkar-view-mode` |

## 5. Progress-state matrix

Progress storage key is date-scoped:
`azkar-progress-YYYY-MM-DD`.

| ID | State | Expected behavior |
|---|---|---|
| P01 | Fresh date / no progress | All visible items start at 0 |
| P02 | Partial item | Current count persists up to target |
| P03 | Completed item | Count is clamped to target; completed visuals appear |
| P04 | Multiple completed items | Progress header shows completed item count, not total repetitions |
| P05 | Progress bar | Width = rounded percentage of completed visible items |
| P06 | Reset | Deletes progress entries for currently visible period items, saves, re-renders |
| P07 | Switch period | Active index resets to 0; same date storage object is reloaded |
| P08 | New calendar date | Different storage key; previous date does not populate the new date |

## 6. Navigation/gesture states

### Exact current runtime

Because `app-core.js` fails to parse, **none of N01–N12 is currently active browser behavior from this script**. This non-running state is `WEB_BUG`, not a native requirement.

### Diagnostic result after removing only the parse blocker

This table records which late implementation would win under JavaScript declaration rules. It is diagnostic and must not be promoted to native behavior without an explicit canonical decision.

| ID | Interaction | Late winning implementation after minimal parse repair |
|---|---|---|
| N01 | Pager “Назад” | Calls late `goTo(activeIndex-1)`; first-page button is disabled |
| N02 | Pager “Далее” | Calls late `goTo(activeIndex+1)`; last-page button is disabled |
| N03 | Swipe left | Next card when `abs(dx)>=55` and `abs(dx)>abs(dy)*1.15` |
| N04 | Swipe right | Previous card under the same threshold |
| N05 | Vertical swipe inside paged card | Long card scroll remains browser/card scroll; late handler has no touchmove interception |
| N06 | Left-edge touch | **No edge reservation in the late winning `bindEvents`**; the earlier 28px reservation is overwritten |
| N07 | Contents jump in cards mode | Calls late `goTo(i)`; no history state write |
| N08 | Contents jump in list mode | Closes modal, renders, smooth-scrolls selected card into view |
| N09 | Open modal | Late handler sets modal directly; **no pushState** |
| N10 | Browser/system Back from modal | No matching modal history entry is created by late handler; reliable close-on-Back is absent |
| N11 | Browser/system Back after card navigation | Late `goTo` does not push state; no reliable previous-dhikr history chain |
| N12 | System color-scheme change in auto theme | One top-level listener exists in source, but current parse error prevents registration |

Additional late-swipe facts:
- no `touchmove` handler;
- no `preventDefault()`;
- no `touchcancel` cleanup;
- no 28px left-edge guard;
- card change calls `scrollToReading(false)` before updating index, scrolling the **document/window** toward the reading toolbar;
- long dhikr content in cards mode scrolls inside `.dhikr-card`; list mode scrolls with the document.

## 7. Theme matrix

Every primary surface and bottom sheet must be checked in:
- Light
- Dark
- Auto → system Light
- Auto → system Dark

No custom colors may be introduced in native implementation without a future contract change.

## 8. Width/layout matrix

CSS defines one explicit responsive breakpoint.

| Width class | Expected web rule |
|---|---|
| >370px | Full toolbar labels; horizontal counter row; 3-column Russian font grid; pager helper visible |
| <=370px | Toolbar label spans hidden; counter row becomes vertical; count button 100% width; pager helper hidden; Russian font grid becomes 2 columns |
| Any width up to container maximum | Shell remains max 760px and centered |
| Safe-area devices | Shell bottom padding, sticky toolbar top, and sheet body bottoms use safe-area insets |

## 9. Motion matrix

| ID | Transition | Existing value |
|---|---|---|
| M01 | Progress fill | 350ms ease |
| M02 | Next card | 620ms cubic-bezier(.16,1,.3,1), +24px → 0, opacity .62 → 1, scale .994 → 1 |
| M03 | Previous card | 620ms cubic-bezier(.16,1,.3,1), -24px → 0, opacity .62 → 1, scale .994 → 1 |
| M04 | Bottom sheet entry | 300ms cubic-bezier(.16,1,.3,1), +18px Y → 0, opacity .7 → 1 |
| M05 | Toggle thumb | 200ms |
| M06 | Reduced motion | All animation/transition disabled; scroll behavior auto |

## 10. Phase-0.5 canonical behavior result

Confirmed:
- `app-core.js` has a syntax error at lines 383–386, so the exact current script has no runtime behavior;
- 9 function names are duplicated;
- in a syntactically valid version, later function declarations would override earlier declarations;
- the late `bindEvents` / `goTo` path differs materially from the earlier history-aware/edge-aware path;
- source-order overwrite is **not** evidence of user-approved product behavior.

Therefore:
- do not copy the blank/non-running web state;
- do not copy duplicate architecture;
- do not treat the earlier history-aware path as active;
- do not treat the later no-history/no-edge path as approved merely because it would win after a minimal parse repair.

The authoritative Phase-0.5 interaction analysis is `docs/NATIVE_BEHAVIOR_CONTRACT.md`.

**Phase 1 is blocked until a valid canonical web revision or an explicit behavior decision resolves swipe/back/history/scroll semantics.**
